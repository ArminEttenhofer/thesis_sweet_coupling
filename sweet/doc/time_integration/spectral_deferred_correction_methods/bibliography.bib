                   of an existing implicit-explicit spectral deferred

                   methods have larger accuracy regions and comparable
                   stability regions. We conduct numerical experiments
                   to compare ETD and IMEX spectral deferred correction
                   schemes against a competing fourth-order ETD

                   Introduction. For simulations of compressible flow,
                   in particular in numerical weather prediction and
                   climate simulations, the presence of acoustic waves
                   can pose significant numerical challenges to the time
                   integration method. Explicit methods are restricted
                   to inefficiently small steps while fully implicit
                   methods are expensive and can artificially slow down
                   high wave number modes. The fully compressible
                   equations can be replaced by filtered models that do
                   not support sound waves [9, 30], but these require
                   solution of a Poisson problem in each step and have
                   difficulties capturing large-scale wave dynamics [8].
                   Therefore, a widely used class of methods are
                   split-explicit integrators: they separate the
                   equation into fast and slow processes which are then
                   integrated with different time step sizes and
                   different (explicit) methods. A popular method of
                   this type is a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme
                   combined with a forward-backward Euler integrator for
                   the acoustic terms [45]. While computationally
                   efficient, split-explicit methods typically require
                   some form of damping for stabilisation [3], which
                   reduces their effective order of accuracy. However, a
                   second-order split-explicit two-step peer method has
                   recently been derived that allows for stable
                   integration of the compressible Euler equations
                   without damping [23]. Another form of splitting are
                   semi-implicit methods. They also split the equations
                   into fast and slow parts but then use an implicit
                   method for the fast and an explicit method for the
                   slow part. In many applications, the fast, stiff
                   terms stem from diffusion and/or rapid chemical
                   reactions and methods with IMEX splitting for
                   equations of reaction-diffusion type have been widely
                   studied [24, 29, 34]. For stratified, com-pressible
                   flows, however, the fast dynamics are not diffusive
                   but stem from acoustic and fast gravity waves while
                   the slow dynamics correspond to slower waves and
                   advec-tion. IMEX splitting methods for such
                   "fast-wave slow-wave" problems [11] have not been as
                   widely studied. Some literature does exist [15, 43],
                   however, and early works go back to the 1970's [25,
                   39]. The performance of IMEX Runge-Kutta methods has},

	abstract = {In this paper we present two strategies to enable "parallelization across the method" for spectral deferred corrections (SDC). Using standard low-order time-stepping methods in an iterative fashion, SDC can be seen as preconditioned Picard iteration for the collocation problem. Typically, a serial Gauss-Seidel-like preconditioner is used, computing updates for each collocation node one by one. The goal of this paper is to show how this process can be parallelized, so that all collocation nodes are updated simultaneously. The first strategy aims at finding parallel preconditioners for the Picard iteration and we test three choices using four different test problems. For the second strategy we diagonalize the quadrature matrix of the collocation problem directly. In order to integrate non-linear problems we employ simplified and inexact Newton methods. Here, we estimate the speed of convergence depending on the time-step size and verify our results using a non-linear diffusion problem.},
